# What is it?

This Ansible role configures basic IPsec IKEv2 VPN server. With default values, connections from most devices (Android and Apple phones, macOS, Windows and Linux) work without any extra configuration on client side, only username, password and CA certificate is required. You definitely want to override `vpn_ikev2_client_list`, `vpn_ikev2_server_common_name`, `vpn_ikev2_server_certificate` and `vpn_ikev2_server_private_key`. Example on how to create self-signed CA and server certificate goes below. Running this role on fresh Ubuntu installation will make you working VPN server at no additional cost.

# VPN Specifications
* IKEv2 based on strongSwan
* eap-mschapv2 used to authenticate client (to support Apple iOS and Windows 10)
* Certificate is used to authenticate server

# Prerequisites

* Ansible 2.4+
* Ubuntu Xenial and Debian Jessie are the only supported target host operating systems for the moment.

# Example: IPsec VPN key generation

Generate CA RSA key pair:

`ipsec pki --gen --outform pem > ca.key`

Generate self-signed CA (adjust DN):

`ipsec pki --self --in ca.key --dn "C=DE, O=Acme Corp, CN=Acme Corp VPN Server CA" --ca --outform pem > ca.crt`

Generate server RSA key:

`ipsec pki --gen --outform pem > server.key`

Generate VPN server certificate (adjust DN):

`ipsec pki --pub --in server.key | ipsec pki --issue --cacert ca.crt --cakey ca.key --dn "C=DE, O=Acme Corp, CN=vpn-server.example.com" --outform pem --san vpn-server.example.com > server.crt`

Install `ca.crt` to trusted storage on client devices. Use `server.crt` and `server.key` with this role (see `defaults/main.yml`)

Keys may be generated by OpenSSL, but keep in mind x509v3 externsions, otherwise server will not be authenticated correctly on some operating systems, like iOS. Refer to strongSwan [documentation](https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/SimpleCA) for more information on certificates and keys.
